# Introduction to Functions

## Exercise 1

Calculate a bill at a restaurant.

Make a dynamic function that takes in 3 arguments: billAmount, taxRate, tipRate
What is the total if you have a $50 bill, 7% tax rate, and a 15% tip rate?


## Exercise 2

You always tip big. You used to be a waiter and you know the struggle.
Make your function from Exercise 1 default to a 30% tip.

## Exercise 3

1. Create a "hello" function that takes in a name and says hello to that person.
2. Create a "yell" function that takes in a string and makes it all capitalized.
3. Create a third function that takes the "hello" and the "yell" functions and returns a string YELLING HELLO AT SOMEONE.
